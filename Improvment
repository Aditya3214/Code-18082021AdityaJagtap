AWS provides priviliges that on every layer we can implement security in AWS. 
So Coming to Infrastructure for my infrastructure create only that much user that are only required and give only that access on which users are going to work.
This Is called Privilage Management.
If any outside Auditor wants to access my system we also have policy for that means we will create a role and attach security policy.In IAM we have a policy for every user to 
set a boundary condition.
For eg: If I gave Lambda full access then if I want to give only 2 access of lambda then i can specify from boundary condition.
So Firstly comes IAM from which I can provide Secure Access Grant.
In S3 we also have security Features like Public Private Access, Policy Based Access Access Control List and Encryption
